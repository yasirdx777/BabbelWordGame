- How much time was invested: 8
- Time distributed:
  - concept: 3 hours
  - model layer: 1 hours
  - views: 1 hours
  - game mechanics: 3 hours
- Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game:
  - generate single word peer on demand to eliminate the need for loop and maintain high performance.
  - create two random index within the given word list bounds to give the ability to generate the highest possible combinations of word peers. 
- Decisions made because of restricted time:
  - use simple MVP design pattern.
  - simple UI design.
- What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time:
  - improve: layer separation, code coverage.
  - add: game results history, word translation voice spelling.
